  </header>

  <section>
    <p>MyMotivFitX ("we", "our", or "us") provides a fitness and wellness app that helps users track workouts, health metrics, nutrition, and more. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and the choices you have regarding your information.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Information we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account or sign in, we collect your email address and any profile information you provide (display name, avatar).</li>
    <li><strong>Health Data:</strong> With your explicit permission, MyMotivFitX may read and/or write HealthKit data (heart rate, workouts, steps, calories, etc.). This data is only accessed with your consent through Apple Health.</li>
    <li><strong>Device & Usage Data:</strong> We collect device identifiers, OS version, app usage metrics, crash logs, and performance data to improve the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> If you enable location features (e.g., activity mapping), we collect precise location data while the app is in use.</li>
    <li><strong>Media & Sensors:</strong> If you use camera, microphone, or photo-related features (e.g., progress photos, voice input), we request access to Camera, Microphone, and Photo Library. Media files you choose to upload are processed and stored per the Storage & Sharing section below.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics & Analytics:</strong> We use third-party analytics and crash reporting to understand app performance and usage. These services may collect device model, OS version, and usage events.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback & Support:</strong> If you submit feedback (email, in-app), we store that message and any attachments (screenshots) to help respond.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use your information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide & maintain the app features (sync workouts, display history).</li>
    <li>Personalize your experience and preferences.</li>
    <li>Process HealthKit data to show workouts, heart rate, and insights (only with consent).</li>
    <li>Improve the app via analytics, diagnostics, and A/B testing.</li>
    <li>Communicate with you (support, updates, and administrative messages).</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing and disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share data in the following limited circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We share data with third-party service providers who perform services for us (analytics, hosting, crash reporting). These providers are contractually restricted from using your data for other purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Apple:</strong> HealthKit data access is handled via iOS/Apple Health APIs; Apple may process your requests per its privacy terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> We will disclose information if required by law or in response to valid legal process.</li>
    <li><strong>Aggregated/anonymous data:</strong> We may share de-identified analytics publicly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Storage & retention</h2>
  <p>We retain personal data as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services. Health data read from HealthKit is handled per your consent and our retention policy. You can request account deletion; after verification, we’ll delete account data within a reasonable timeframe (typically 30 days). Some logs or backups may be retained for a limited time for legal or technical reasons.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use commercially reasonable security practices (encryption in transit, secure storage) to protect your data. No system is 100% secure; report suspected breaches to <a href="mailto:security@yourdomain.com">security@yourdomain.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Your choices and rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account:</strong> You can update or delete your account in the app or by contacting support.</li>
    <li><strong>Health data:</strong> You control HealthKit permissions in iOS Settings → Health. Revoking permission stops new reads/writes; previously synced data may remain on our servers until deleted.</li>
    <li><strong>Location and media:</strong> You can change Camera, Microphone, Photo Library, and Location permissions in iOS Settings for MyMotivFitX.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> To opt out of analytics/tracking, use the in-app settings or contact support.</li>
    <li><strong>Data access and deletion:</strong> Contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@yourdomain.com">privacy@yourdomain.com</a> to request data export or deletion. We may need to verify your identity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>MyMotivFitX is not directed to children under 13 (or equivalent minimum age). If you believe we have collected data from a child under the applicable age, contact us and we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>International transfers</h2>
  <p>Data may be processed and stored in the United States (or where our service providers operate). By using the app, you consent to transfer, storage, and processing in those locations.</p>

  <h2>Third-party services and links</h2>
  <p>The app may include links or integrations with third-party services (e.g., social sign-in, analytics). Their services are governed by their privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their practices.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy. We’ll post the updated policy here and in the app with a revised effective date.</p>
